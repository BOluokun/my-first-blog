        <p>Hi! My name is Beauty and  I'm 14 years old.</p>
        <p>I live in London and I am in year 10.</p>
        <p>My favourite things to do are programming, watching youtube videos and eating food (especially jaffa cakes).</p>
        <p>Also, my favourite subjects are maths, music and computer science.</p>
        <p>I am currently doing my GCSEs and it's fairly stressful so I hope I can use this blog as a outlet to relieve my stress while,
        maybe, bringing joy to others.</p>
